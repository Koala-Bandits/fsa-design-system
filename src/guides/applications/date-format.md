## Allowable Date Formats

In order to work with the widest range or date formats and to improve User workflow, the following formats shall be allowed to be entered.

 * MMDDYYYY
 * MM/DD/YYYY
 * MM/DD/YY
 * M/D/YYYY
 * MM-DD-YYYY
 * MM-DD-YY
 * M-D-YYYY
 * MM.DD.YYYY
 * MM.DD.YY
 * M.D.YYYY
 * M.D.YY

If the date entered is not __MM/DD/YYYY__, then the date should be automatically formatted to __MM/DD/YYYY__ when the focus on the date field is changed or an action button is clicked.
