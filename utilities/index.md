intro: "Single-purpose styles typically mapped to a single CSS property and value (e.g. margin)."

Utilties &ndash; also known as “trumps,” “helper classes,” or “alterations,” &ndash; are high-specificity selectors for making very targeted alterations to existing elements or components.

They are most useful when you want to override a default value, in one-off situations, or even to explore design ideas; though be aware that they often use an `!important` flag in the CSS to ensure the desired alteration is achieved by superceding an element's default style.
