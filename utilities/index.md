title: "Utilities"
intro: "CSS Utilities are single-purpose styles that can be appended to elements and components. They are typically mapped to a single CSS property and value (e.g. margin), and are most useful when you want to override a default value or in one-off situations."

Also known as “trumps,” “helper classes,” or “alterations,” these are high-specificity selectors used to make very targeted alterations to existing elements or components. Be aware that they often use an `!important` flag in the CSS to ensure the desired alteration is achieved by superceding an element's default style.
