## Top Navigation

Based on new standards in web design, all FSA applications should include a "Mega Menu" format paired with a top navigation system that flows from left to right on the application screen. The top navigation should be distinguishable and positioned in a horizontal bar just below the header of the application. Navigation systems located in a left-side or right-side panel should NOT be used for FSA applications. 

## Navigation Rules

  * A "Home" link will always be available, left justified and as the first option in the top navigation
  * No more than 6 additional navigation categories shall be used in the top navigation
  * Navigation dropdowns or sub-lists shall only contain 2 - 9 sub-navigation options
  * If only 1 navigation is used, it should link directly to the page or content and not contain a dropdown or sub-navigation
  * Teriary navigation shall not be used in FSA applications due to accessiblity concerns.

Below is a sample screenshot of and FSA application with a Mega Menu navigation system.
