## Global Navigation

Based on new standards in web design, all FPAC applications should include a "Mega Menu" format paired with a global navigation system that flows from left to right on the application screen. The global navigation should be distinguishable and shall be positioned in a horizontal bar just below the header of the application. Navigation systems located in a left-side or right-side panel shall not be used for FPAC applications.

## Navigation Rules

  * A "Home" link shall be available, left justified and as the first option in the global navigation
  * No more than 6 additional navigation categories shall be used in the global navigation
  * Navigation dropdowns or sub-lists shall only contain 2 - 9 sub-navigation options
  * If only 1 navigation is used, it shhall link directly to the page or content and not contain a dropdown or sub-navigation
  * Tertiary navigation shall not be used in FPAC applications due to accessibility concerns.

Below is a sample screenshot of and FPAC application with a Mega Menu navigation system.
