intro: "FSA Applications shall have a consistent header and shall utilize the header component (and associated styles) defined in the Design System.

Fonts, colors, alignment, etc shall not be modified from the common header component provided by the design system.  Nor shall applications add customizations such as logos, imagery, icons, etc."

Below is a sample screenshot of an FSA application header that represents a good example of the below guidelines.

## Department and Agency

The department name and agency name shall be displayed in a consistent style and location as seen in the above example. These elements shall not be customized per application. The Design System will provide responsive behavior based on screen size and condense this section as the screen gets smaller.

## Application Name

The application name shall display as shown in the following format: a paired acronym to the left of the application name that is fully spelled out. On smaller screens and resolutions, only the application acronym will be shown.

## Application Logo

FSA applications shall not use an application logo. 

## Application Help

All FSA applications shall use a help icon located next to the User name (see below screenshot) to access the application's help system. When clicked the User will be taken to a separate page with instructions on how to receive help, based on the specific application. The content of the help system shall be decided by Business Requirements for the specific application. The design system only specifies a consistent mechanism to access the help system.

## User Profile & Control System

When a User is logged in to an FSA application their Display Name will be shown right justified and next to the Application Help icon. A Dropdown shall be available to control User specific details and actions. The following labels and controls shall always be available within the User Control dropdown:

  * User Role Label(s)
  * View/Edit Profile Link
  * Application Sign Out Button
