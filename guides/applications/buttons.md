## Button Guidelines:

 * All buttons SHOULD use an action word to start the label. Eg. "View Details" vs. "Details"
 * A Cancel button SHALL NOT be used unless the online form uses a multi-step process.
 * A Cancel button SHALL be used in a Multi-step or multiple screen process so the User feels safe that they are aborting a process.
 * A Cancel or Close button action SHALL clear the contents of the online form for security/privacy purposes.
 * When used, the Cancel button SHOULD appear as a link or Alternative button.
 * In a multi-step or multiple screen process, Back and Next SHALL be used as button labels.
 * In a multi-step or multiple screen process, the saving of data or state is implied and clicking the Back button SHALL NOT delete data that has been entered.
 * In a multi-step or multiple screen process, Save or Submit SHALL be used on the final step.
 * Buttons SHOULD align to the left with primary or affirmative action on left and secondary or dismissive action on right
 * Reset & Clear buttons:
   * Reset - defined as removing all data and returning to the initial state of the application or online form inputs.
   * Clear - defined as removing all data from application or online form fields.
   * Reset and Clear buttons, if used, SHALL NOT be placed near the Next, Submit, or Save buttons.
