## General Guidelines

 * In general, a single column of input fields is recommended
 * Two column layouts can be used when grouping of form fields requires paired structure
 * Labels shall be top aligned
 * All form elements shall be aligned to the left
 * The use of Placeholders shall not replace Labels
 * Labels shall always be visible
 * Font and Font weights shall remain consistent
 * Form fields shall each be uniform length and use Design System CSS
 * Form fields shall have enough space for completion of entry
 * Reduce as much visual noise as possible by eliminating unnecessary fields for the task
 * Content groupings should be intuitive and aligned together for better cognitive response


## Single vs Two Column Layout

In general, FSA applications should use a single column layout when possible. There are instances when a two or multi-column layout is appropriate which will be determined based on the complexity and groupings of the form fields.

### Single Column Example

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}img/subcategories/applications/forms-single-column.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}img/subcategories/applications/forms-single-column.jpg" alt="Image of Single Column Form"></a>

___

### Two Column Example

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}img/subcategories/applications/forms-two-column.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}img/subcategories/applications/forms-two-column.jpg" alt="Image of Two Column Form"></a>
