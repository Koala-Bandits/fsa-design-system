intro: "How we talk about Section 508 when we write about it at FSA."
---

## The Law

Section 508 is part of the 'Rehabilitation Act of 1973.' The law was amended in 1998 to add 508 which requires that government agencies provide equal access to information to disabled employees.

The correct way to refer to the law is:

* Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. ยง 794 (d)).
* Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.
* Section 508.

While related in ways, the Rehabilitation Act is not part of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

## Key Words

* **Conformance:** we conform with the standards of Section 508, not the law of Section 508.
* **Compliance:** a government agency is in compliance with the law.

## Talking Points

* The goal of accessibility at FSA is to build sites that are usable by everyone, not to meet minimum standards.
* We focus on building accessibility into every step of a project, from design to each sprint review.
* Employing accessibility best practices improves the user experience of all users.
* FSA guidelines and best practices are not intended to be a replacement or supplement for Section 508 standards, but are tools to achieving these standards in modern web development.
