Anytime a plugin is used on a page, they must be tested for accessibility.

**Pro-tip:** Flash nearly always fails for accessibility.

## Testing

1. Identify any plugins on the page
2. Identify a link to download each plugin
 * Plugin download links can be provided on a single page. Ensure this page is referenced on pages that require plugins.
3. Check each plugin for accessibility
  * Most plugins have a VPAT available on the manufactures website which lists its accessibility findings
