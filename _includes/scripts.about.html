### Disclaimer

All JavaScript included in the FSA Design System's CSS Framework, [fsa-style](http://usda-fsa.github.io/fsa-style/), are **not approved for Production use**. Their role is purely for **demonstration purposes only**, providing development teams with the inspiration, reference, and guidance to fully implement a component's UI behavior.

Script demonstrations are primarily UI-oriented, typically manipulating the HTML is basic ways (i.e. [DOM Scripting](http://alistapart.com/article/javascript-for-web-designers "A basic intro to DOM Scripting")). Two frequent examples:

* Adding and/or removing a class, e.g. `addClass('component-name--active')`
* Adding and/or removing an attribute, e.g. `setAttribute('aria-expanded', 'false')`
