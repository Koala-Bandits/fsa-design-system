# FPAC Design System Site

Open Source design resource and guidelines establishing a cohesive user experience across USDA Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC).

The Design System comprises of two core repositories:

1. **[fsa-design-system](https://github.com/USDA-FSA/fsa-style/)**: Source code for the [Design System web site](http://usda-fsa.github.io/fsa-design-system), documenting `fsa-style` and accompanying guidelines.
1. **[fsa-style](https://github.com/USDA-FSA/fsa-style/)**: CSS Framework: style assets (HTML, CSS, Images) available for download or install, as documented by the [Design System web site](http://usda-fsa.github.io/fsa-design-system).

## Using fsa-style

Refer to [Design System > Get Started](http://usda-fsa.github.io/fsa-design-system/getting-started/) for directions on using fsa-style assets as a dependency.

## Running fsa-design-system locally

The [Design System site](http://usda-fsa.github.io/fsa-design-system) is built using [Jekyll]() for the file framework and static site, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for task management, incorporates the [fsa-style node module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fsa-style) for its style, and is deployed via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) at http://usda-fsa.github.io/fsa-style/.

### 3. Building the documentation with Grunt

The documentation is built using Grunt automation. To use Grunt, first make sure you have it installed on your machine (globally):

```sh
npm install -g grunt-cli.
```

To start, run the following command to install Ruby and NPM dependencies:

```sh
npm run install-dep
```

Now that all of your dependencies are installed, you can run your local server by running the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:4000/fsa-design-system/ in your browser â€” you should be viewing a local instance of http://usda-fsa.github.io/fsa-design-system/.
