# FSA Design System Site

Open Source design resource and guidelines defining the next generation of FSA digital products, setting a new bar for simplicity and consistency across the USDA Farm Service Agency.

The FSA Design System comprises of two core repositories:

1. **[fsa-design-system](https://github.com/USDA-FSA/fsa-style/)**: Source code for the [FSA Design System web site](http://usda-fsa.github.io/fsa-design-system), documenting the FSA Style and accompanying guidelines.
1. **[fsa-style](https://github.com/USDA-FSA/fsa-style/)**: Style assets (HTML, CSS, Images) available for download or install, as documented by the [FSA Design System web site](http://usda-fsa.github.io/fsa-design-system).

## Using fsa-style

Refer to [FSA Design System > Get Started](http://usda-fsa.github.io/fsa-design-system/getting-started/) for directions on using fsa-style assets as a dependency.

## Running fsa-design-system locally

The [FSA Design System site](http://usda-fsa.github.io/fsa-design-system) is built using [Jekyll]() for the file framework and static site, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for task management, incorporates the [fsa-style node module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fsa-style) for its style, and is deployed via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) at http://usda-fsa.github.io/fsa-style/.

```

Now that all of your dependencies are installed, you can run your local server by running the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:4000/fsa-design-system/ in your browser â€” you should be viewing a local instance of http://usda-fsa.github.io/fsa-design-system/.
